# Gesture-controlled IoT nightlight with ESP8266WiFi

## Features

* LED color can be set on the web interface
* Brightness is controlled by holding your hand above the distance sensor. Increasing/decreasing
the distance increases/decreases the brightness. Removing your hand fixes the brightness.

The LED color is saved to EEPROM on each color update. Therefore, changing the color on the interface in
a quickly swept fashion is not recommended. Right now the color wheel interface uses the onClick event,
and does not support swiping or mouse dragging, so this is not a problem.

Using a HC-SR04 ultrasound distance sensor module has proven to be problematic, especially in confined environments,
where multiple reflections can occur. The VL53L0X laser sensor has shown a much better performance.

## Hardware
